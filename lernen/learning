envp[0] = "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
envp[1] = "HOME=/home/yourusername"
envp[2] = "USER=yourusername"
envp[3] = "SHELL=/bin/bash"
envp[4] = "LANG=en_US.UTF-8"

envp[n] = NULL;  // Marks the end of the array


-----------------------------------------------------
outfile = open(argv[4], O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC, 0644);

2. Flags: O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC
These flags dictate how the file is opened, and they are combined using the bitwise OR operator (|).

O_CREAT
Purpose: If the file specified by argv[4] does not exist, this flag instructs the system to create it.

O_WRONLY
Purpose: Opens the file in write-only mode. This means the file descriptor returned will only allow writing to the file.

O_TRUNC
Purpose: If the file already exists, O_TRUNC will truncate itâ€”that is, it will shorten the file's length to zero. This ensures that any previous contents are removed before writing new data.

--------------------------------------
3. File Permission Mode: 0644
This numeric value specifies the permissions to set on the file if it needs to be created (because of O_CREAT).

0644 translates to:
Owner: Read and write permissions.
Group: Read-only permission.
Others: Read-only permission.
0 is for octal

--------------------------------------
Putting It All Together

-Opens the file named in argv[4] with write-only access.
-Creates the file if it does not exist.
-Truncates the file to zero length if it already exists (ensuring you start with an empty file).
-Sets the permissions of the newly created file to 0644 (read/write for the owner and read-only for group and others).

In the context of your program, this is used to prepare the output file (for example, file2 in your pipex program) to receive the output from the second command (or second process).
